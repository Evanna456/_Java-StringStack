## About Java

Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. 
It is a general-purpose programming language intended to let programmers write once, run anywhere (WORA), meaning that compiled Java code can run 
on all platforms that support Java without the need to recompile. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any 
Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of the underlying computer architecture.
